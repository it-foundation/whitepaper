# Overview

**WalkIt**, a walk-to-earn web3 application reward users with our native KIP-7 token, ITT,  as they move about. Through instant gratification in the form of tokens, WalkIt aims to get more users to exercise while **introducing** them into the land of web3.&#x20;

Our reward token, ITT,  can be converted into SGD directly through a liquidity pool or it can also be used in our ITT token-only e-commerce marketplace to buy items. With these utility for the ITT tokens to start off, more utility will be added into it as we progress further hence driving up the value of the token.
